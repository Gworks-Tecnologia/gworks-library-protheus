## Skills by Category

### Code Generation

Skills that generate production-ready code structures following TOTVS framework standards.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [mvc-generator](mvc-generator/SKILL.md) | Generates Protheus MVC screen structures — `ModelDef`, `ViewDef`, `MenuDef`, and `BrowseDef` — for single-entity (Model 1) and master-detail (Model 3) patterns using `FWFormModel`, `FWFormView`, and `FWFormBrowse`. |
| [tlpp-rest-endpoint-generator](tlpp-rest-endpoint-generator/SKILL.md) | Generates TLPP REST endpoints using annotation-based routing (`@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Patch`, `@Delete`) with the `oRest` object. Follows TOTVS TTALK API standards including pagination, error model, and Swagger documentation. |
| [entry-point-designer](entry-point-designer/SKILL.md) | Designs and documents Protheus Entry Points with proper `User Function` signatures, `PARAMIXB` parameter layouts, return value specifications, and defensive programming patterns. |
| [query-builder](query-builder/SKILL.md) | Builds optimized and secure SQL queries for Protheus tables. Includes mandatory filters (`D_E_L_E_T_`, branch), index-driven query design, SQL injection prevention, and patterns for both Embedded SQL (preferring `FWExecStatement`) and Workarea (`DBSelectArea`/`DBSeek`). |

### Migration and Modernization

Skills that guide incremental migration from legacy patterns to modern frameworks.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [advpl-to-tlpp-migration](advpl-to-tlpp-migration/SKILL.md) | Migrates legacy AdvPL code (`.prw`) to modern TLPP (`.tlpp`). Covers file extension change, `#include "tlpp-core.th"`, namespace adoption, type annotations, Try-Catch, WsRESTful REST migration, long identifiers, inline JSON, named parameters, access modifiers, and `StaticCall` removal. |

### Code Quality and Review

Skills that enforce quality standards, detect issues, and improve existing code.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [code-review](code-review/SKILL.md) | Comprehensive AdvPL/TLPP code review covering 8 categories: Security (SQL injection, credentials), Performance (workareas, loops), Legacy/Deprecated Constructs, Metadata Access, ProtheusDOC Documentation, Clean Code, TLPP-specific checks, and Compilation. Generates severity-ranked findings with SonarQube rule references. |
| [sql-code-review](sql-code-review/SKILL.md) | SQL-focused code review covering injection prevention, access control, data protection, query structure analysis, index strategy, anti-pattern detection, and database-specific best practices for PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. |
| [refactor](refactor/SKILL.md) | Surgical code refactoring to improve maintainability without changing behavior. Addresses 15 code smells (long methods, duplicated code, nested conditionals, magic numbers, etc.) with safe extraction patterns and AdvPL/TLPP-specific guidance. |
| [refactor-method-complexity-reduce](refactor-method-complexity-reduce/SKILL.md) | Targeted cognitive complexity reduction in a specific method through focused helper method extraction. Analyzes nested conditionals, repeated blocks, and complex boolean expressions, then restructures the method as a high-level orchestrator. |
| [sql-optimization](sql-optimization/SKILL.md) | SQL performance optimization including query tuning, index strategy, pagination, batch operations, execution plan analysis, and Protheus-specific database tuning. Works with PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. |
| [utf8-to-cp1252-conversion](utf8-to-cp1252-conversion/SKILL.md) | Converts AdvPL/TLPP source files from UTF-8 to Windows-1252 (CP1252) after code generation. The Protheus compiler requires CP1252 — includes dependency-free native scripts (Bash+iconv for Linux/macOS and PowerShell+.NET for Windows) with BOM detection, backup, batch processing, and CI/CD integration. |

### Testing

Skills that generate automated test scripts for both business logic and UI validation.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [tir-test-generator](tir-test-generator/SKILL.md) | Generates **TIR** (TOTVS Interface Robot) end-to-end test scripts in Python for Protheus SmartClient/Webapp screens. Covers CRUD screen tests, MVC screen tests, grid interaction, report parameter screens, field validation, and message box assertions using `tir.Webapp`. |

### Documentation and Planning

Skills for documenting code and planning implementation work.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [documentation-writer](documentation-writer/SKILL.md) | Generates ProtheusDOC comment blocks (`/*/{Protheus.doc}`) for AdvPL/TLPP source code. Covers functions, classes, and methods with all supported tags (`@type`, `@param`, `@return`, `@author`, `@since`, `@example`, etc.) following the official TOTVS standard. |
| [data-dictionary-lookup](data-dictionary-lookup/SKILL.md) | Queries the TOTVS Protheus ERP data dictionary (SX2 tables, SX3 fields, SIX indexes, SX6 parameters, SX5 generic tables, SX7 triggers, SX1 questions, SX9 relationships, SXB standard queries, SXG/SXA groups). Also used during refactoring, migration, or code improvements for dictionary impact validation. |
| [context-map](context-map/SKILL.md) | Generates a context map of all files relevant to a task before implementing changes. Identifies files to modify, dependencies, test files, reference patterns, and produces a risk assessment for the planned changes. |
| [create-implementation-plan](create-implementation-plan/SKILL.md) | Creates phased, machine-readable implementation plan files for features, refactoring, upgrades, or architectural changes. Plans are structured for autonomous execution by AI agents or humans, with atomic tasks, validation criteria, and dependency declarations. |
