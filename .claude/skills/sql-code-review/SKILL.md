# SQL Code Review

Perform a thorough SQL code review of ${selection} (or entire project if no selection) focusing on security, performance, maintainability, and database best practices.

## Review Categories

### 🔒 Security

- **SQL Injection Prevention** — all user inputs must be parameterized; no string concatenation in queries
- **Access Control** — principle of least privilege, role-based permissions, schema security
- **Data Protection** — avoid `SELECT *` on sensitive tables, enforce audit logging and data masking

### ⚡ Performance

- **Query Structure** — eliminate `SELECT DISTINCT *`, prefer explicit JOINs over comma-separated FROM
- **Index Strategy** — verify indexes for WHERE/JOIN columns, flag over-indexing and unused indexes
- **Join Optimization** — correct join types, optimal join order, no accidental Cartesian products
- **Aggregation** — replace correlated subqueries with JOIN/GROUP BY when possible

### 🛠️ Code Quality

- **Formatting** — consistent uppercase keywords, aligned columns, proper indentation
- **Naming** — descriptive table/column names, no reserved words as identifiers, consistent casing
- **Schema Design** — appropriate normalization, optimal data types, proper constraints and defaults

### 🗄️ Database Compatibility

- **ANSI SQL first** — use COALESCE, CASE WHEN, ANSI JOINs, FETCH FIRST for portability
- **Database-specific idioms** — leverage engine-specific features (JSONB, COLUMNSTORE, sequences) where appropriate

> **Protheus note:** Use `ChangeQuery()` to automatically translate SQL syntax to the active database dialect. BeginSQL/EndSQL calls `ChangeQuery()` automatically.

## Bundled Reference Files

This skill uses progressive disclosure. The SKILL.md body covers the review workflow, category definitions, checklist, and output format. Detailed code examples, anti-patterns, and database-specific best practices are in the `references/` directory — read them on demand based on the scenario:

| Reference File | When to Read | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [references/sql-security-patterns.md](references/sql-security-patterns.md) | Reviewing **security concerns** — SQL injection, access control, data protection, or dynamic SQL | Injection examples, parameterization patterns, access control checklist, data masking examples |
| [references/sql-performance-and-quality-patterns.md](references/sql-performance-and-quality-patterns.md) | Reviewing **query performance**, **code style**, **anti-patterns**, or **testing strategies** | Query optimization examples, JOIN/aggregation patterns, N+1 and DISTINCT anti-patterns, formatting standards, data integrity checks |
| [references/database-specific-best-practices.md](references/database-specific-best-practices.md) | Reviewing SQL targeting a **specific database** (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) or **cross-database portability** | ANSI SQL cross-database patterns, PostgreSQL (JSONB, GIN), SQL Server (NVARCHAR, COLUMNSTORE), Oracle (sequences, VARCHAR2) |

> Also refer to [references/sonarqube-rules-reference.md](../references/sonarqube-rules-reference.md) for the complete SonarQube rules reference shared across skills.

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Scope and Database

Determine from the user's request:

- Which SQL files or queries to review
- Target database engine (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, or multi-database)
- Review focus (security, performance, quality, or full review)

### Step 2: Load Relevant References

Based on the review focus and database, read the appropriate reference files:

- **Security focus** → read [references/sql-security-patterns.md](references/sql-security-patterns.md)
- **Performance / quality focus** → read [references/sql-performance-and-quality-patterns.md](references/sql-performance-and-quality-patterns.md)
- **Database-specific review** → read [references/database-specific-best-practices.md](references/database-specific-best-practices.md)
- **Full review** → read all three reference files

### Step 3: Analyze Code Against Checklist

Walk through each category in the checklist below. For each finding, classify priority as CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.

### Step 4: Generate Report

Use the Issue Template (below) for each finding. Group findings by category and sort by priority.

## Protheus SQL Patterns

When reviewing SQL in the TOTVS Protheus ecosystem — whether embedded SQL (preferring `FWExecStatement`, with legacy `TCQuery` / `TCSqlExec` calls), Workarea-based access, or standalone queries — apply the following additional checks.

### Table and Field Naming Conventions

Protheus uses standardized short-name tables and fields managed through the data dictionary:

| Alias | Module | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| SA1 | All | Customers |
| SA2 | All | Suppliers |
| SB1 | SIGAEST | Products |
| SC5 | SIGAFAT | Sales Orders (header) |
| SC6 | SIGAFAT | Sales Orders (items) |
| SD1 | SIGACOM | Purchase document items |
| SD2 | SIGAFAT | Sales document items |
| SE1 | SIGAFIN | Accounts Receivable |
| SE2 | SIGAFIN | Accounts Payable |
| SF1 | SIGACOM | Incoming invoices (header) |
| SF2 | SIGAFAT | Outgoing invoices (header) |
| SX2 | System | Table dictionary |
| SX3 | System | Field dictionary |
| SIX | System | Index dictionary |

Fields follow the pattern `<prefix>_<name>`, e.g., `A1_COD` (customer code), `A1_NOME` (customer name), `D1_DOC` (document number).

### Mandatory Filters for Protheus Tables

Every query against a Protheus table **must** include these filters unless there is an explicit reason to omit them:

```sql
-- BAD: Missing mandatory filters — returns deleted records and all branches
SELECT A1_COD, A1_NOME FROM SA1010

-- GOOD: Proper Protheus query with mandatory filters
SELECT A1_COD, A1_NOME
FROM SA1010
WHERE D_E_L_E_T_ = ' '
  AND A1_FILIAL  = '01'
```

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `D_E_L_E_T_ = ' '` | Excludes logically deleted records (soft delete). Always required. |
| `<prefix>_FILIAL = cFilAnt` | Multi-branch filter (tenant isolation). Required unless deliberately querying across branches. |

### Workarea vs. Embedded SQL Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|----------|---------------------|
| Single-record lookup by index key | Workarea (`DbSelectArea` / `DbSetOrder` / `DbSeek`) |
| Sequential processing of a filtered set | Workarea with `While` loop |
| Complex joins across multiple tables | Embedded SQL via `FWExecStatement` |
| Aggregate queries (SUM, COUNT, AVG) | Embedded SQL via `FWExecStatement` (use `:ExecScalar()` for single values) |
| Bulk INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations | `FWExecStatement` + `TCSqlExec(oStatement:GetFixQuery())` |
| Reports with heavy filtering | Embedded SQL via `FWExecStatement`, or temporary tables via `TCSqlExec` |

### Workarea Access Review Checklist

```advpl
// GOOD: Complete workarea access pattern
DbSelectArea("SA1")
DbSetOrder(1)           // Set the index defined in SIX
If DbSeek(FWxFilial("SA1") + cCodCli)
  // process record...
EndIf
```

- [ ] `DbSelectArea()` called before any workarea operation
- [ ] `DbSetOrder()` set to the correct SIX index
- [ ] `DbSeek()` includes branch prefix via `FWxFilial()`
- [ ] Write operations wrapped with `RecLock()` / `MsUnlock()`
- [ ] `While` loops include `!Eof()` and `SA1->(DbSkip())` pattern

### Embedded SQL Review Checklist

```advpl
// GOOD: Parameterized embedded SQL via FWExecStatement (DB-side bind, cacheable)
Local cQuery as Character
Local oExec  as Object
Local cAlias as Character

cQuery := "SELECT A1_COD, A1_NOME "
cQuery += "FROM " + RetSqlName("SA1") + " SA1 "
cQuery += "WHERE D_E_L_E_T_ = ? "
cQuery += "AND A1_FILIAL = ? "
cQuery += "AND A1_COD = ? "

oExec := FWExecStatement():New(ChangeQuery(cQuery))
oExec:SetString(1, ' ')
oExec:SetString(2, FWxFilial("SA1"))
oExec:SetString(3, cCodCli)

cAlias := oExec:OpenAlias("QRY_CLI")
// ... consume (cAlias)->A1_COD / A1_NOME ...
(cAlias)->(DbCloseArea())
oExec:Destroy()
```

- [ ] Uses `RetSqlName()` to get the physical table name (handles company suffix)
- [ ] Includes `D_E_L_E_T_ = ' '` filter
- [ ] Includes branch filter via `FWxFilial()`
- [ ] Temporary alias is closed after use (`QRY_CLI->(DbCloseArea())`)
- [ ] String values are sanitized to prevent SQL injection (use `FWExecStatement` — no raw user input concatenated)

### Common Protheus SQL Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Missing `D_E_L_E_T_` filter | Returns deleted records | Always add `D_E_L_E_T_ = ' '` |
| `SELECT *` on Protheus tables | Protheus tables have many system fields; wastes bandwidth | Select only needed columns |
| Full table scan on SD1/SD2/SE1/SE2 | These transactional tables can have millions of rows | Use indexed columns in `WHERE` clause |
| Missing `%nolock%` on SQL Server | Causes lock escalation on read queries | Add `%nolock%` hint: `FROM SA1010 WITH (%nolock%)` — the `%nolock%` DBAccess macro translates to `WITH (NOLOCK)` on MSSQL and is silently ignored on PostgreSQL/Oracle (MVCC) |
| Concatenating user input into SQL | SQL injection vulnerability | Use `FWExecStatement` or `TcGenQry2` to parameterize queries |
| Not closing temporary aliases | Resource leak, workarea pollution | Always `QRY->(DbCloseArea())` after use |
| Hardcoding table suffix (e.g., `SA1010`) | Breaks in multi-company environments | Use `RetSqlName("SA1")` |
| Creating procedures directly in source | Prohibited — violates SonarQube rules | Use SPManager for procedure management |
| Direct queries without evaluation (Cloud) | Queries may not be Cloud-compatible | Evaluate Cloud impact; prefer framework APIs where available |
| Using SE5 table directly | SE5 is deprecated | Use `FKx` family functions + `ExecAuto` |
| Using IIF in SQL or AdvPL expressions | Prohibited for clean code | Replace with `CASE WHEN` (SQL) or `If/Else/EndIf` (AdvPL) |

### SIX Index Dictionary Awareness

Protheus indexes are defined in the SIX dictionary. When writing queries or using workareas:

- **Check available indexes** before choosing `DbSetOrder()` — using the wrong order leads to full scans
- **Index 1** is typically: branch + primary key (e.g., `A1_FILIAL + A1_COD + A1_LOJA`)
- **Composite indexes** should be leveraged in `WHERE` clauses matching left-to-right column order
- **Never create ad-hoc indexes** in production without SIX registration

### Protheus SQL Security

- **Never concatenate raw user input** into SQL strings — use `FWExecStatement` or `TcGenQry2` for parameterized queries
- **Never expose table structure** in error messages returned to the client
- **Validate input length** against SX3 field size before inserting/updating
- **Use `FWExecView`** for user-facing queries when possible (respects field-level security)
