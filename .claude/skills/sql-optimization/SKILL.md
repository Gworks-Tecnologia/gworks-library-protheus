# SQL Performance Optimization Assistant

Expert SQL performance optimization for ${selection} (or entire project if no selection). Focus on universal SQL optimization techniques that work across PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and other SQL databases.

## Core Optimization Areas

This skill covers query performance analysis, index strategy, subquery optimization, JOIN optimization, pagination, aggregation, query anti-patterns, batch operations, temporary tables, index management, and performance monitoring.

For all universal SQL optimization patterns with BAD/GOOD code examples, see [sql-optimization-patterns.md](references/sql-optimization-patterns.md).

## Universal Optimization Checklist

### Query Structure
- [ ] Avoiding SELECT * in production queries
- [ ] Using appropriate JOIN types (INNER vs LEFT/RIGHT)
- [ ] Filtering early in WHERE clauses
- [ ] Using EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries when appropriate
- [ ] Avoiding functions in WHERE clauses that prevent index usage

### Index Strategy
- [ ] Creating indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] Using composite indexes in the right column order
- [ ] Avoiding over-indexing (impacts INSERT/UPDATE performance)
- [ ] Using covering indexes where beneficial
- [ ] Creating partial indexes for specific query patterns

### Data Types and Schema
- [ ] Using appropriate data types for storage efficiency
- [ ] Normalizing appropriately (3NF for OLTP, denormalized for OLAP)
- [ ] Using constraints to help query optimizer
- [ ] Partitioning large tables when appropriate

### Query Patterns
- [ ] Using LIMIT/TOP for result set control
- [ ] Implementing efficient pagination strategies
- [ ] Using batch operations for bulk data changes
- [ ] Avoiding N+1 query problems
- [ ] Using prepared statements for repeated queries

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Testing queries with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Analyzing query execution plans
- [ ] Monitoring query performance over time
- [ ] Setting up alerts for slow queries
- [ ] Regular index usage analysis

## 📝 Optimization Methodology

1. **Identify**: Use database-specific tools to find slow queries
2. **Analyze**: Examine execution plans and identify bottlenecks
3. **Optimize**: Apply appropriate optimization techniques
4. **Test**: Verify performance improvements
5. **Monitor**: Continuously track performance metrics
6. **Iterate**: Regular performance review and optimization

Focus on measurable performance improvements and always test optimizations with realistic data volumes and query patterns.

## Protheus SQL Optimization

The TOTVS Protheus ERP has specific database access patterns and constraints that require targeted optimization strategies. This covers cross-database compatibility, high-volume table optimization, SIX index alignment, NOLOCK hints, `FWExecStatement`/`TCSqlExec` performance (preferred over legacy `TCQuery`), and Workarea vs. Embedded SQL decision guidance.

For complete Protheus-specific optimization patterns, code examples, and the high-volume table reference, see [sql-optimization.md](references/sql-optimization.md).

### Protheus-Specific Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Queries on SD1/SD2/SE1/SE2/CT2 include branch filter and use indexed columns
- [ ] `SELECT *` is not used — only necessary columns are selected
- [ ] `D_E_L_E_T_ = ' '` is present on every Protheus table query
- [ ] Read-only queries use `%nolock%` hint (cross-DB safe — translates on MSSQL, ignored on PostgreSQL/Oracle)
- [ ] No `FWExecStatement`, `TCQuery` or `TCSqlExec` calls inside loops — batch with `:SetIn()` or a single statement
- [ ] Temporary aliases opened by `FWExecStatement:OpenAlias()` (or legacy `TCQuery ... New Alias`) are closed after use and `:Destroy()` is called
- [ ] `RetSqlName()` is used instead of hardcoded table names (e.g., `SA1010`)
- [ ] Complex reports use SQL with proper JOINs instead of nested workarea loops
- [ ] `FWExecStatement` is used when user input is part of the query
- [ ] Index usage verified against SIX dictionary entries
- [ ] No `IIF()` in SQL construction — use `CASE WHEN` or `If/Else/EndIf` in AdvPL logic
